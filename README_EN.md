# Futebots: Genetic Algorithms for Soccer Agents

Activity in Python designed by Professor Lucas Figueiredo. The objective is to exercise the concept of genetic algorithms using natural selection to select the best robot soccer team throughout the evolution of generations.

## üî® Project Features

- **Robot Soccer Simulation**: Uses genetic algorithms to simulate the behavior of robotic soccer players, evolving their strategies over generations.
- **Position and Speed Updates**: The position and speed of players and the ball are updated based on interactions and game rules.
- **Performance Evaluation**: Assesses team performance through metrics such as ball control, positioning, and shot accuracy.
- **Game Visualization**: Renders the soccer field, players, and ball, displaying the score and total game time using OpenCV for graphics and image manipulation.
- **Player Evolution**: Adjusts player parameters based on the performance of their actions, using genetic algorithms for continuous optimization.
- **Interactivity**: Allows observation of player evolution and game dynamics in real time, with visual feedback and updates during the simulation.
